# CSS-Final-project
Final project

This project involves me using the style stage website's html and making my own css.
I have taken inspiration from the famous japanese figure known as "Ryoumen Sukuna" when it comes to the design
of this webpage.

I have cited any sources that I have used in a separate txt file.
